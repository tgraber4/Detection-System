# Detection and Replica System
---------------------------------

This program records all mouse movements, mouse clicks, and keyboard actions. Then it generates a command file that you can play back later.

Allows you to replicate anything you do on a computer anytime you want.

Setup:
1.) pip install pyautogui <br>
2.) pip install pynput <br>
